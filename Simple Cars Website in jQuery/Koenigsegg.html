            Numbers speak volumes when it comes to describing the quickest thing yet to come out of Ängelholm,
            Sweden that doesn’t have jet engines and air-to-air missiles. The Koenigsegg One:1 costs £2 million. Its
            turbocharged,
            ethanol-fuelled V8 develops more than 1300bhp. In the right conditions, claims its maker, it’s capable of
            cracking
            250mph from rest in less than 20sec. And yet it’s easier to drive at sane speeds than our tester could
            believe,
            making plenty of torque off boost – although the action of the automated twin-clutch gearbox takes some
            getting used to.

            <br>
            The One:1 is a real white-knuckle ride, by contrast, when you squeeze its accelerator pedal floorwards and
            listen as those turbochargers spool up, sending greater and greater force towards a pair of rear wheels that
            can run short of traction even in the higher gears. But when the One:1's aerodynamics
            start to work and it finally hits its stride above 125mph, it's nothing short of otherworldly.
