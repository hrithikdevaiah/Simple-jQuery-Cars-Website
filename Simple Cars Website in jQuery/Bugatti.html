            The Volkswagen Group’s trophy brand, Bugatti, made history when it gave us the fastest production car in the
            world in 2005.
            The W16-engined, 987bhp, four-wheel-drive Veyron broke through the 250mph barrier.
            But it couldn’t and wouldn’t be regarded as the ultimate performance car forever.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enter, in 2016, the Chiron. Where the Veyron used aluminium spaceframe construction, the Chiron has a
            lighter carbonfibre
            monocoque. Where the Veyron stopped short of 1200bhp in its final forms, the Chiron ups that to nearly 1500.
            And where the Veyron left Bugatti’s top speed yardstick at 268mph,
            the Chiron (which had still to prove how fast it can go as these words were written) is expected to
            get within touching distance of 290.
            <br>
            <br>
            And if you want a hypercar to make record speeds so easy to achieve, this is the one for you.
            Bugatti’s more fiercely blown sixteen-cylinder engine certainly has a bit of turbo lag to haul through and
            isn’t the sweetest-sounding of leviathan lumps – more departing hovercraft or express train than car.
            But when it starts to surge, it knows absolutely no moderation. The car’s ride is firm and its handling
            perhaps just a tiny bit underwhelming. But making such incredible speed as attainable as the Chiron makes it
            remains a towering
            achievement – it’s utterly remarkable for being so unremarkable.
