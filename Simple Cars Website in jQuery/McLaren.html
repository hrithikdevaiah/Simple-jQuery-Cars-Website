            When McLaren adopted the name of its most revered and tragically fated F1 racing driver to use as the model
            identity
            of its latest 'ultimate series' hypercar, a sharp intake of breath was taken throughout the motorsport world
            and the
            car industry alike. Could invoking the memory of such a legendary, much-missed figure as Ayrton Senna, and
            then using
            it to do something as corporate as selling a new car - any car - ever be made to look like a good idea? Was
            Ayrton's
            name really McLaren's to use?
            <br>
            <br>
            The Senna is a car of truly astonishing track abilities. Even though its not the most powerful car to have
            lapped
            our dry handling circuit, it has such phenomenal reserves of grip that it smashed our dry handling track lap
            record
            by fully a second-and-a-half when we road-tested it in 2018. Developing some 800kg of downforce at its peak,
            and
            with a growling V8 of just under 800-horsepower, it's a car you expect to be a nerve-testing challenge on
            track,
            and almost impossible to drive on the road. The simple fact is, neither is true.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Senna looks after you, and keeps looking after you with its feedback, stability and drivability, as you
            hit
            the kinds of speeds only usually known to prototype racing machines. It's a physical test to drive, but a
            supreme,
            unforgettable mental treat. And although it's less broad-batted and usable than most hypercars of its price,
            its dedication of the business of going quickly, round in two-and-a-half-mile circles, is utterly
            spellbinding.
