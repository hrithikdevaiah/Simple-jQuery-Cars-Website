            Ferrari’s latest top-of-the-tree hypercar is nothing less than the greatest and most sensational peak that
            the
            performance car has ever reached. Powered by an incredible, spine-tingling, naturally aspirated, 789bhp
            6.3-litre
            V12 assisted by 161bhp of electric power channelled direct to the rear wheels, the LaFerrari’s powertrain
            makes an
            incredible 950bhp all told. Although we never got the chance to strap our timing gear to one,
            Ferrari claims the car hurls itself to 62mph in just 2.4sec and to 186mph in just 15sec.
            <br>
            <br>
            And yet, in spite of its enormous performance and mind-boggling mechanical complication, the LaFerrari has
            absurdly benign and exploitable limit handling manners that make it so much more approachable and exciting
            to
            drive on a circuit than you’d ever believe it could be.
            <br>

            Ferrari charged more than £1million for each car. It made 500 in all, producing the last of them in 2015,
            and has so far succeeded it only with the FXXK track special and the LaFerrari Aperta convertible.
            The LaFerrari is a monument to everything Ferrari does singularly well and still our reigning hypercar
            standard-bearer.
